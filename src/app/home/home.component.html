      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      I’m a senior at Florida International University studying Computer Science and Software Engineering, and I hold a degree in English from FIU. My background in English has equipped me with strong communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills, allowing me to approach technology not just as code, but as a way to create clear, human-centered solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before transitioning into tech, I spent 15+ years in fine dining and upscale hospitality at some of Miami’s most iconic restaurants, including MILA, which was recently named the #1 highest‑grossing independent restaurant in the United States. That experience taught me how to operate seamlessly under pressure, anticipate needs, and deliver exceptional experiences; skills I now bring to software development and project design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I channel the combination of technical knowledge, communication expertise, and customer-focused insight into building software that makes people’s lives easier and more connected. I have experience with full-stack development, RESTful APIs, and generative AI, gained through coursework as well as a summer internship at Tekin Software, where I worked on a variety of impactful projects from concept to deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of tech, I’m passionate about music and tabletop games. On my days off, you’ll probably find me jamming out with close friends or at a local game store turning cards sideways.
